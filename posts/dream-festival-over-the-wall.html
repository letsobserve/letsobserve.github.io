              <br />
              <p>I find myself at my Grandma's house. I'm hosting a party here, so I try my best to setup the place nicely for my friends- who are arriving very soon. I place lots of chairs, a few tables and board games around the living room, in hopes that this will be a great party.</p>
              <br />
              <p>When my friends arrive, everybody decides they want to play battleship. Luckily I have multiple copies of the game, so everyone is able to play at the same time. We all play against each other at the same time, so one players guess will affect everyone who is playing. The party continues on like this for a while and as some players lose all their ships they leave the party as well.</p>

              <p>At the end of the party, my Grandma approaches me and asks me for $1000 to cover the repairs that the house needs because of all the damage my friends caused. This confuses me a lot, as I don't believe that my friends could possibly cause that much damage to the house. My Grandma then starts to list off some of the damages that occurred, most of the seem ridiculous. One of the reasons she gives is that there's now a big hole in the bedroom wall.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I ask her to show me this hole in the wall, my Grandpa then comes over to me and guides me to the bedroom. As I walk in I immediately notice that there's a giant wooden ramp filling up most of the room, which leads up to a hole in the roof. That must be the hole that my Grandma is talking about. I'm stunned for a second as I've never seen anything like this in my life.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I'm curious as to where this ramp leads, so I decide to carefully make my way up and through the whole in the roof. The higher I climb on this ramp, the more I can hear music somewhere outside. When I get to the top of the ramp, I see there's also a ramp on the opposite side of the wall. I can see off in the distance that there's a music festival not too far away from here.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I start to make my way down the other side of the ramp and walk towards the festival. The music gets louder and louder as I get closer, which continually builds my excitement. I excitedly line up to enter the festival. When I get to the front of the line I place the backpack I suddenly have on into one of the lockers that are freely provided.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I pick one of the stages to go to randomly. I begin to listen to the music and dance, enjoying myself and the moment. Before I know it the light begins to fade from the sky. It quickly starts to get dark, so I decide it's probably time to head home.</p>
              <br />
              <p>Heading back to the entrance, I see that the free lockers that were once at the front of the festival are now gone. In it's place are a bunch of tents and police. One of the tents is for the collection of bags and confiscated items, so I line up to collect my things.</p>

            <section class="conclusion">
              <br />
              <p>It's my turn to collect my bag now. I look around the tent and I can see so many bags that look like mine. I have to open up a few bags to check if it's mine. I open up one bag that looks like mine and I see my water bottle, my jacket and everything else that was in my bag. I pick it up, slinging it over my shoulder and head towards the gate.</p>
              <br />
              <p>At the gate, I'm stopped by two police officers. They ask that I pay a fee for the collection of my bag. Immediately I ask if this is legal, I point out that the lockers that I put my bag in to begin with were advertised as free. The officers can see that I'm getting angry and upset. They ask me to calm down and comply with them or they'll have to escalate this situation. I reluctantly pay the fine and I'm allowed to exit.</p>
              <br />
              <p>There's a long walk across a field from the festival to my house. As the crowd slowly exits the festival people start to chant and sing their favourite songs aloud. I look around at everyone and I can see a group of girls running around without tops on. Some are trying their best to cover themselves but some are not, I can't help but stare at them as I walk.</p>
              <br />
              <p>As I walk the ground slowly turns from grass to sand. Instead of heading home, I start to head to the beach. A lot of the crowd from the festival follow my lead and begin heading to the beach.</p>

        <h3>Some background...</h3>
        <br />
        <p>I had this dream back in October 2017.</p>
        <p>Upon waking up I was really surprised at the turns that took place during this dream. The dream started off with a party with my friends, then mainly became me enjoying a music festival and ended with me walking to the beach.</p>
        <p>I remember having the feeling of excitement and being happy throughout most of the dream. I think this was a short time after I attended a music festival in real life.</p>
