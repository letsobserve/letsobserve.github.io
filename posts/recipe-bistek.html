								<h2>Tips and My Thoughts</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Bistek, a really simple and fast meal to cook that is deliciously salty and sour. Typically viewed as a 'poor' peoples dish in the philippines due to the simplicity of the dish. Honestly, this is a great dish for those on a budget, and lasts for a week in the fridge for a quick meal to heat up when you get hungry. Can be cooked with either beef or pork but personally, I prefer pork- especially if it has a big chunk of fat.</p>
								<br />
								<p>The meat can be left to marinade in the fridge for 1-2 hours depending on how thick you cut the meat and if you have the time. You can also leave it for 5 minutes or less if you're in a rush and it tastes just as good. Leaving the meat to marinade longer only tenderizes the meat more- helpful if you only have access to a cheaper cut of meat.</p>
								<br />
								<p>Make sure to not let the sauce evaporate too much for this dish, as it goes great drizzled onto rice- which you'll absolutely love. I'd also recommend not over-cooking the onions as they are the only vegetable in this dish and you don't want them to disappear.</p>
