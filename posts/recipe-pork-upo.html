								<h2>More Information</h2>
								<br />
								<p>Pork Upo is a traditional filipino dish that is really easy to make, healthy and absolutely delicious. This dish is typically viewed as a 'poor' dish, which can be seen by the very little amount of ingredients that are necessary to cook, this also makes the dish very cheap which is great for large families or those on a budget (or both!).</p>
								<br />
								<p>The most difficult part of this dish is getting the pork cooked correctly, you're aiming for a caramelised sauce covering the pork. Take a look at the image example below to get an idea of what the pork should be like. Of course you should try to use feeling to get an idea of when to move onto the next step.</p>

								<p>You can cook the pork for longer if you have a particularly tough cut of meat, just remember to keep adding water so your pork doesn't burn. Otherwise, this dish is very quick to make and is great is you have little time to cook after work or you meal prep for the week.</p>
								<br />
								<p>Ensure that the garlic and onions are cooked through before adding the upo as you don't want to bite into raw garlic when eating this dish.</p>
