								<p>A close up look at an instantly recognisable flower. The sunflower. I found it fascinating to see all the little nodes that make up the inner pad of a sunflower. It's also bright, beautiful and has that 'summer' feel.</p>

						<h2 class="h-margin">Current Interests...</h2>
						<br />
						<p>I'm currently interested in all things coding. So far I have been self teaching languages such as; Javascript, CSS, HTML, C# and VBA.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Of course I am no expert, there's always room for improvement. However, I would love to share my projects and interests on here with everyone to learn and gain inspiration from.</p>
						<br />
						<p>I will be exploring more about coding over the coming weeks. I find the challenge of translating an idea that seems simple into statements that a computer can understand absolutely fascinating.</p>

						<h3 class="center-text">More About Observe</h3>
						<br />
						<p>This is idea started back in late 2019, leading to the creation of a YouTube Channel-<a class="aboutMeLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeoi7YeUK-iyexnpiJVo4g" target="_blank" title="Observation Youtube Channel">Observation</a> where I could show off the beauty of the natural world. Fast-foward to today and the idea has evolved into this website that can further explore the things that interest me, like nature, food, tech and dreaming- all which I feel most passionate towards.</p>
						<br />
						<p>This website is completely coded by me- Jordan Hewett from the bottom up. No website builder, no out-sourcing, just a text editor and a lot of googling and stack overflow. It was important to me to be able to make this myself, having complete control to be able put my heart and soul into it and being able to continually learn and expand my knowledge of website development.</p>
						<br />
						<p>This website also acts as a hub for all the things that my interest shifts towards over the weeks, months and years. I've found that I go through phases of interests over time. Being able to collect all those interests into a single point on the internet is something I find infinitely valuable. It creates the freedom for me to go through all these phases and keep track of my progress in each thing that interests me. I'm able to look back on this website and remember everything I like, all the thoughts I've had and continue to improve on all my knowledge. I hope you find some value from browsing my website, like I do.</p>
